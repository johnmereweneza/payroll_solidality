- MetaMask : for wallet connection


4. Getting Started
____________________

A. Prerequisites : 

- Node.js: https://nodejs.org/
- Hardhat: https://hardhat.org/
- MetaMask :https://metamask.io/

B. Installation

bash : 
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/payroll-dapp.git
cd payroll-dapp
npm install
ðŸ›  Deployment
Compile and deploy the contract locally using Hardhat:

bash
Copy
Edit
